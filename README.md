# PlanetsXML
Used for populating the planets.xml and 0002_planetevents.xml for MekHQ.

I am just starting out with learning VB.NET and have this app up on github for easy viewing and sharing.
I value all input and collaboration with this project but,
am not wanting any new code written for me or I will miss out on learning how to write that code and understand all of this.
